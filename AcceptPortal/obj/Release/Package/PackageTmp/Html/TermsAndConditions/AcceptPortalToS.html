The Notice of Infringement must substantively comply with the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and must contain the following information as set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A), which provides:</p>
        <p>To be effective under this subsection, a notification of claimed infringement must be a written communication provided to the designated agent of a service provider that includes substantially the following:</p>
        
            <ul>
