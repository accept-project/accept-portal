This folder is the placeholder for placing the compressed version of the Pre-Edit client.

after pasting the file here, make sure the View file:

../Views/Download/Index.cshtml 

more specifically code line 17:

<a href="@Url.Action("DownloadFile", "Download", new { file = "accept-jquery-plugin-v3.0.zip" })">
        <img style="width:250px;" src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/download_button.png")" alt="" />
</a>

the file name(in this example case: "accept-jquery-plugin-v3.0.zip") matches the one from the file placed in this folder.
